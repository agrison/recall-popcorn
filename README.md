### What is it?

Recall PopCorn is an ionic application whose goal is to recall movies you wanted to see but didn't.

It searches for movies on IMDb via omdbapi.com

It's a one night dev project, it certainly misses some love to shine.

### How to use

Clone the repository then:

    cd recall-popcorn
    ionic run android or ios
